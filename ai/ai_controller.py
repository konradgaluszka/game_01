AI Controller for Real-Time Soccer Gameplay

This module bridges trained reinforcement learning models with the live soccer game.
It loads PPO models trained in the SoccerEnv and translates their decisions into
real-time player actions during gameplay.

**Key Functions**:
1. **Model Management**: Load/unload trained RL models from .zip files
2. **State Translation**: Convert game state to training observation format  
3. **Action Execution**: Translate RL actions to player movement commands
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Handle missing models without crashing the game

**Integration**: Called every frame from main.py to control team_2 (blue team)
when a trained model is available. Provides seamless human vs AI gameplay.

    Real-time AI controller that uses trained RL models to control team_2.
    
    **Purpose**: Bridge between offline RL training and live gameplay
    
    **Workflow**:
    1. Load trained PPO model from .zip file
    2. Each frame: Convert game state â†’ observation vector
    3. Model predicts actions for all 5 team_2 players
    4. Apply actions as movement forces to player physics bodies
    
    **Key Features**:
    - Handles model loading errors gracefully
    - Maintains same observation format as training environment
    - Provides deterministic action selection for consistent play
    - Falls back to no-op if model unavailable
